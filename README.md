This Rust program uses the Miller-Rabin primality test to see if a given number is prime. The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic algorithm used to determine the primality of big numbers.

The program has two main functions.
1.'mod_exp' performs modular exponentiation.
2.'miller_rabin_test': Determines whether an integer is likely to be prime by applying the Miller-Rabin primality test.
